<FONT SIZE="4"><STRONG><B><BR>
 &nbsp &nbsp <FONT COLOR="Red"> Swap <FONT COLOR="Yellow"> is a very easy game to play. &nbsp The game starts out with four different Characters and each Character has four different colors. &nbsp The idea is very simple. &nbsp All you have to do is arrange the Characters so that no 2 touch each other, either on the edges or on the corners, that are the same color or have the same design. &nbsp The example on the right has <FONT COLOR="White"> not <FONT COLOR="Yellow"> been solved.

<BR><BR> &nbsp &nbsp You may put the Characters and the Colors in whatever order you like. &nbsp In other words, if you start in the upper lefthand corner, you may put any one of the 16 Characters there. &nbsp So there are many possibilities. &nbsp Wow, this game is even easier than I thought.

<BR><BR> &nbsp &nbsp Move the Characters by swapping their positions. &nbsp Click 2 Characters that you want to <FONT COLOR="Red"> Swap<FONT COLOR="Yellow">, then press the <FONT COLOR="Cyan"> Enter <FONT COLOR="Yellow"> key. &nbsp The last 2 Characters you clicked will be swapped. &nbsp If you don't like the new positions, press the <FONT COLOR="Cyan"> Enter <FONT COLOR="Yellow"> key again and they will go back to their previous positions. &nbsp You may click more than 2 Characters if you wish. &nbsp For example, lets say you want to <FONT COLOR="Red"> Swap <FONT COLOR="Yellow"> the <FONT COLOR="White"> Red <FONT COLOR="Yellow"> and the <FONT COLOR="White"> Blue <FONT COLOR="Yellow"> Arrows, but you accidently click the <FONT COLOR="White"> Green <FONT COLOR="Yellow"> one first. &nbsp No problem! &nbsp Just click the <FONT COLOR="White"> Red <FONT COLOR="Yellow"> Arrow, then the <FONT COLOR="White"> Blue <FONT COLOR="Yellow"> Arrow. &nbsp Press <FONT COLOR="Cyan"> Enter<FONT COLOR="Yellow">, and you're all set. &nbsp The <FONT COLOR="White"> Red <FONT COLOR="Yellow"> Arrow and the <FONT COLOR="White"> Blue <FONT COLOR="Yellow"> Arrow will switch places, and the <FONT COLOR="White"> Green <FONT COLOR="Yellow"> one will stay right where it was.<BR><BR>

<BR> &nbsp &nbsp Some of the Characters look nice and some don't, so I decided to include some more choices. &nbsp <FONT COLOR="Cyan"> Type of Characters <FONT COLOR="Yellow"> allows the user to select from the following: &nbsp <FONT COLOR="Cyan"> Numbers<FONT COLOR="Yellow">, <FONT COLOR="Cyan"> Upper Case Alpha<FONT COLOR="Yellow">,  <FONT COLOR="Cyan"> Lower Case Alpha<FONT COLOR="Yellow">, <FONT COLOR="Cyan"> All Alpha <FONT COLOR="Yellow"> (Upper and Lower Case), <FONT COLOR="Cyan"> Wingding Characters<FONT COLOR="Yellow">, <FONT COLOR="Cyan"> Special Characters<FONT COLOR="Yellow">, and <FONT COLOR="Cyan"> All Ascii Characters<FONT COLOR="Yellow">. &nbsp I have created a text file called <FONT COLOR="White"> Swap.Opt <FONT COLOR="Yellow"> that will save the <FONT COLOR="Cyan"> Type of Characters <FONT COLOR="Yellow"> that the user has chosen.<BR>

<BR> &nbsp &nbsp If you choose one of the first 3 <FONT COLOR="Cyan"> Character Types<FONT COLOR="Yellow">; <FONT COLOR="Cyan"> Numbers<FONT COLOR="Yellow">, <FONT COLOR="Cyan"> Upper Case Alpha<FONT COLOR="Yellow">, or <FONT COLOR="Cyan"> Lower Case Alpha<FONT COLOR="Yellow">, you will be offered one more choice; <FONT COLOR="Cyan"> Random<FONT COLOR="Yellow"> or <FONT COLOR="Cyan"> Sequential<FONT COLOR="Yellow">. <BR>

<BR> &nbsp &nbsp For example, if you select <FONT COLOR="Cyan"> Upper Case Alpha<FONT COLOR="Yellow">, then <FONT COLOR="Cyan"> Sequential<FONT COLOR="Yellow">, the puzzle characters will be <FONT COLOR="White"> A<FONT COLOR="Yellow">, <FONT COLOR="White"> B<FONT COLOR="Yellow">, <FONT COLOR="White"> C <FONT COLOR="Yellow"> and <FONT COLOR="White"> D<FONT COLOR="Yellow">. <BR><BR>

<BR><BR><BR><BR><BR> &nbsp &nbsp There is an option on the Menu (shown at left) to select the <FONT COLOR="Cyan"> Puzzle Size<FONT COLOR="Yellow">. &nbsp You may select any format from <FONT COLOR="Cyan"> 4*4 <FONT COLOR="Yellow"> thru <FONT COLOR="Cyan"> 9*9<FONT COLOR="Yellow">. <BR><BR><BR><BR><BR>

<BR> &nbsp &nbsp There are many different Characters in this game and they are picked at Random, so it should be different every time you play. &nbsp Some of the Characters look very similar but there should not be any duplicates. &nbsp If it is too difficult to tell one Character from another, just click the <FONT COLOR="Cyan"> Menu <FONT COLOR="Yellow"> at the top of the screen, select <FONT COLOR="Cyan"> Options<FONT COLOR="Yellow">, then <FONT COLOR="Cyan"> Restart<FONT COLOR="Yellow">. &nbsp That will start a new game with all new Characters and colors.<BR><BR><BR>

<BR> &nbsp &nbsp <FONT COLOR="Cyan"> Solve <FONT COLOR="Yellow"> will show one possible answer to the puzzle, however, there are many other possible solutions too. &nbsp <FONT COLOR="Cyan"> Solve <FONT COLOR="Yellow"> currently provides a prefab solution. &nbsp It is a real solution to the puzzle, using the current Characters & Colors, but it provides the answer using a predetermined algorithm. &nbsp <FONT COLOR="Cyan"> Solve <FONT COLOR="Yellow"> is a <FONT COLOR="White"> Work-in-progress<FONT COLOR="Yellow">. &nbsp I am still working on a more random solution but it has proven to be much more difficult than I anticipated. <BR><BR><BR>

 &nbsp &nbsp The BackGround colors of the boxes are chosen at random, but only from a select list. &nbsp I also employed a simple swap routine to make sure that a color is not repeated in a single game. &nbsp Some colors still look very similar and it may be difficult to tell them apart, so I added the <FONT COLOR="White"> ToolTipText <FONT COLOR="Yellow"> which contains the Color Name and the Ascii Number of the  Character. &nbsp Simply pause the mouse cursor over a box and the Color name and Ascii Number will be displayed.<BR>

 &nbsp &nbsp New &nbsp (<FONT COLOR="White">Oct. 27, 2006<FONT COLOR="Yellow">): &nbsp You may now <FONT COLOR="White"> Right Click <FONT COLOR="Yellow"> on any box to change the Color of it. &nbsp All tiles with the same Color will also be changed. &nbsp You may select any color that is available on the PC. &nbsp I would suggest not to make it too dark though because the Character may become unreadable. &nbsp Most colors do not have names associated with them, therefore I will display the RGB Color in the <FONT COLOR="White"> ToolTipText<FONT COLOR="Yellow">. &nbsp <BR>

 &nbsp &nbsp When you correctly solve a screen, you will know it because you will immediately get a nice little <FONT COLOR="White"> Congratulations! <FONT COLOR="Yellow"> from me. &nbsp Each time you solve a screen, you will have the option to move up to a higher level .... if you dare! &nbsp <FONT COLOR="Red"> Swap <FONT COLOR="Yellow"> currently has 6 different playing levels (<FONT COLOR="Cyan">4*4 <FONT COLOR="Yellow"> thru <FONT COLOR="Cyan"> 9*9<FONT COLOR="Yellow">). &nbsp 6 levels may not sound like much, but I think you will find it challenging enough just to get through the first 3 levels. <BR><BR>

 &nbsp &nbsp I'm sorry, but I have no idea how many possible winning combinations there are. &nbsp If you figure it out, please write and tell me how you got your answer. &nbsp OK. that's it. &nbsp Have fun and <FONT COLOR="#FF0000"> Swap <FONT COLOR="Yellow"> till you drop!
